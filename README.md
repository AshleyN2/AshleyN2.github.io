# Introduction
This is a project where I created a simple weekly planner with the implementation of HTML, CSS, JS and applied a db.json.
It is a single page website with a layout that enables a user to plan their week by listing down tasks and removing them off the list once they are accomplished.

### Deployed link
` https://ashleyn2.github.io/`


## Structure of my code 
I have structured my code as follows:
* `index.html` file that has the frontend page elements 
* `style.css` file that has the styling details of the page elements
* `index.js` file that has the backend functionalities 
* `db.json` that has API and server data.

### Deliverables
1. A user should be able to select a specific day from a [drop-down] menu.
2. A user should be able to input tasks they endevor to accomplish for the week.These tasks will be listed down as the user adds them.
3. A user should be able to delete a task from their list once they have accomplished it.
4. A user can get a weekly focus that is a reminder of high priority tasks for the week and delete the tasks once they have been completed.

# Landing Page
Below is the landing page with an illustration of data that has been fetched and rendered on the weekly focus section. The assumption is that a user selected Friday and added two new tasks to their list.
