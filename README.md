# Introduction
This is a project where I created a simple weekly planner with the implementation of HTML, CSS, JS and applied a db.json.
It is a single page website with a layout that enables a user to plan their week by listing down tasks and removing them off the list once they are accomplished.

## Structure of my code 
There is an `index.html` file that has the frontend page details, `style.css` file that has the styling details of the page, `index.js` file that has the backend details and `db.json` that has API and server details.

### Deliverables
1. A user should be able to select a specific day from a [drop-down] menu.
2. A user should be able to input tasks they endevor to accomplish for the week.These tasks   will be listed down as the user adds them.
3. A user should be able to delete a task from their list once they have accomplished it.
4. A user can get a weekly focus that is a reminder of high priority tasks for the week.
